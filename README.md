# My Personal Project

### Gamiyfing my Life

The application is intended to **gamify** my life by keeping track of my habits using
a radar chart, as if I were a character in an RPG. When a task that improves my stats
is completed (e.g. run a mile), I will log the activity and the radar chart will grow 
to represent an improvement in that category (e.g. health).

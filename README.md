# My Personal Project

### Gamiyfing my Life

The application is intended to **gamify** my life by keeping track of myself using
a stats circle, as if I were a character in an RPG. When a task that improves my stats
is completed (e.g. run a mile), the stats circle will grow 
to represent an improvement in that category (e.g. health).

This project is intended to be used for **myself**. I think the idea of stat circles
is fun since there are many inspiring stories that demonstrate
character growth through stats circles. With a visual 
representation of my own growth, I hope to become more disciplined and motivated.

Example stats circle *categories*:
- Health
- Physical ability
- Intelligence
- Wealth
